Issues:
- weird velocity shift thing when a bubble hits off circle
  - limit velocity????
- some way of randomizing the direction of initial bubbles. maybe when you create one, it starts out slow and increases velocity.
- UI float not really working in safari
- resizing window bug....should it just reset?
- not unpausing when close out of smaller screen things

to do:
- finalize info panel content
- info panel link color
- check browser compatibility
- question mark icon instead of hamburger one?

think about:
- adding a reset button
- bubbles taking on color of the circle that it hits
- decrease collider circle sizes on smallest screens?
- putting controls on smaller screen version?
