# Bubble Tones
Bubble tones is a cutomizable generative music program that aims to produce pleasing, unpredictable, elevator-quality tones. It is powered by p5*js.

### Using Bubble Tones
Using Bubble Tones is easy. If you're looking to enjoy tones with zero effor, simply launch the site and listen. The single bubble will produce a tone each time it connects with a wall or a circle in the middle of the screen.

For more sophisticated tones, try clicking/tapping inside the screen to add more bubbles. The more bubbles, the more opportunities for unique blends of tones.

### Audio Interactions
When a bubble collides with the "walls" of your browser window, it plays a tone based on the selected key and scale.
